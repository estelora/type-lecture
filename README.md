# Web Typography
- A brief course about web type for software developers.
- Includes slides, demo files, and an outline.
- <strong>Goal:</strong> Make into a video.

##Why is web typograpy important?
- Good type design makes getting information easy.
- More and more written information is going digital; this means a working knowledge in digital type is a must.
- Form and Function is necessary to keep users engaged.
- Strong type design skills are essential for web development.

### Objectives:
- Define following type terms: <i>point</i>, <i>serif</i>, <i>sans-serif<i>.
- Know what an <i>em</i> is and how it is important for web design.
- Remember ideal line-heights for type and ideal width of line for type.
- Understand how to find and put Google fonts in html, css, and scss.
- Become familiar with the concept of combining fonts and knowing how to find good font combinations.

### Basic Body Copy Conventions:
- Body copy means big blocks of text together. (not headings)
- Print body copy: 65-75em wide, leading 120% of line-height (different than web, em is 
  larger on the web for some reason).
- Web Body Copy: 27-38em wide, line-height 1.3-1.5 ems.
- Avoid <i>orphans</i> and <i>widows</i> if possible. It is hard for the user.

### Choosing good font combinations:
- Body copy means big blocks of text together. (not headings)
- I suggest one serif font and one sans serif font.
- Look up other people's font combinations (search 'good google font combinations)

### Exercises: 
- Try adding a new Google Font combination to the <i>great-gatsby.html</i> file.
-  Mess around with the <i>great-gatsby.css</i> file.
